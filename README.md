In this project, I have built breast cancer prediction using python machine learning. I have used logistic regression model for model training. The dataset used in this project is used from sklearn datasets i.e. loading breast cancer datasets from sklearn. The target label is two type of tumor they are: 
1 --> Benign
0 --> Malignant
